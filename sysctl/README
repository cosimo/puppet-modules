Puppet module for sysctl
========================

Usage:

    include sysctl

    sysctl::settings { "10-vm-swappiness":
        content => "vm.swappiness = 5"
    }

    sysctl::settings { "varnish-performance":
        priority => 20,
        source => "puppet:///files/some/path",
    }

There's also some preset files. For example:

    sysctl::lvs_direct_routing { "lvs-dr":
        ensure => "present"
    }

    sysctl::tcp_performance { "your-name-here":
        ensure => "present",
        priority => 25,
    }
