Puppet module for timezone
==========================

Usage:

    include timezone

If you want to set a different timezone,
I think you should be able to do:

    class { "timezone":
        timezone => "Europe/Oslo"
    }

Or:

    class { "timezone":
        timezone => "America/Los_Angeles"
    }

Be sure that whatever you use as $timezone
actually exists in `/usr/share/zoneinfo/$timezone`.
