Puppet module for rsyslog
=========================

Usage:

    include rsyslog

This module is implemented so we have not only
the package installed, but also rsyslog always
guaranteed to be running.

You can also add configuration snippets with
a define like:

    include rsyslog

    rsyslog::conf { "someproject-somename":
        content => "..."
        #  or
        #source => "puppet:///...",
    }
